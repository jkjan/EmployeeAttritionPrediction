## Employee Attrition Prediction


### 1. About
This model is to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions  
such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’  
or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’.  
&nbsp;  
For this I used 
[IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance data](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset),  
which is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.  
More information in the link above.
